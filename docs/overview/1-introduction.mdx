<DeploymentsRedirect />

0xSS is a shared sequencing network that allows many rollups to share a single
decentralized network of sequencers. These sequencers are simple and
permissionless to join, completely replacing centralized sequencers.

This shared sequencer network provides out-of-the-box censorship resistance,
fast block confirmations, and atomic cross-rollup composability – all while
retaining each rollup’s sovereignty. 0xSS envisions a future where thousands
of decentralized rollups flourish, each one tailored to meet the unique
requirements of different industries, applications, and use cases.

To achieve this vision, we believe that deploying an economically secure,
decentralized, and censorship-resistant rollup should be as easy as deploying a
smart contract.
